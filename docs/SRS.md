## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Grocery Expense Tracker is a desktop application that allows users to manage grocery-related expenses by recording grocery bills, products, and pfand transactions. The app enables users to track costs, organize purchases into categories, and calculate total expenses.

### 1.2 Scope
The application is intended for personal use on a desktop environment. It provides CRUD functionality for grocery-related data while keeping a set of system-defined reference data (units, categories, subcategories, store types, and currencies).

Key capabilities include:
* Creating and managing products.
* Recording grocery bills and related items.
* Logging pfand (deposit) transactions.
* Associating bills with stores, addresses, and currencies.
* Automatic calculation of discounts and totals.

### 1.3 Definitions & Abbreviations
* **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
* **Pfand**: Bottle deposit system in Germany and other regions.
* **Entity**: Database object with attributes.

### 1.4 References
* IEEE 830 SRS template (for structure)
* Qt 6 documentation
* SQLite documentation

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Grocery Expense Tracker is a **standalone desktop GUI application** with a local SQLite database. There are no external APIs or multi-user access.

### 2.2 Product Features
* CRUD operations on products, bills, bill items, addresses, stores, and pfand transactions.
* Pre-seeded reference data for units, categories, subcategories, currencies, and store types.
* Store and address linkage for location tracking.
* Support for different currencies in bills.
* Automatic computation of total price, discounts, and pfand balances.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
* A single user (the person installing the app).
* Basic knowledge of desktop applications.
* No authentication or user roles required.

### 2.4 Constraints
* Desktop only (Windows, compiled with MSVC 2022).
* Uses SQLite (no external DB).
* Single-user local application (no networking).

### 2.5 Assumptions & Dependencies
* User will maintain data consistency (e.g., select correct category for products).
* Pre-fed data (units, categories, subcategories, store types, currencies) is immutable.
* Qt must be installed/configured on the system.
